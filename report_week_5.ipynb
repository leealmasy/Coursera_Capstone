    "Selecting a new retail location is a problem for any business. In this article the use of the K-Means algorithm in conjunction with the FourSquare database data will be used to narrow down potential neighborhoods in New York and Toronto that may be candidates for a new bakery location.  The K-means algorithmn  In the competitive world of real estate acquisistion, having the means to identify specific neighborhoods for specify business locations should be a valuable tool.\n",

    "Data for New York City (NYC) neighborhoods will be retrieved from https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset. Specifically the Borough, Latitude and longitude of each NYC neighborhood. Similarly, data for Toronto will be retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M. Both cities' data will be converted to Pandas DataFrames and the two DataFrames merged into one combined DataFrame ('all_data') . The FourSquare database will be utilized to obtain the individual venue names and associated latitude and longitude for all neighborhoods.\n",
    "</h4>\n",
    "<h4>\n",
    "Connect to FourSquare and using the 'all_data' DataFrame, feed the Neighborhood, Lat, and Long of all neighborhoods into a function which retrieves the ['Neighborhood', 'Lat', 'Long', 'Venue', 'Venue Lat', 'Venue Long', 'Category'] for all the neighborhoods' venues and stores those results in a DataFrame ('all_venues'). A radius of 300 meters was used to retrieve venues and their Lat and Long for every neighborhood.  A google search result for 'average city block' area of a NY city block was 100,000 sq ft.  Assuming a neighborhood is 3x3 block region, a 300 meter neighborgood radius seemed resonable as an initial estimate.  \n",

    "Methodology:\n",
    "    </h3><h4>\n",
    "1) create a one-hot-encoded DataFrame where the venue categories are the columns and and the rows are the Neighborhoods. The 'zeroes' and 'ones' will are used to associate attributes (venues) with Meighboroods.  Next,  convert one-hot-coded to frequencies ('all_grouped').One hot encoding for the venue categories for each neighborhood</h4><h4>\n",
    "2) Create a function to find the top 10 venues for each neighborhood and store results as a DataFrame ('all_venues_sorted').\n",
    "</h4><h4>\n",
    "3) Remove the Neighborhood column from the 'all-grouped' and perform a K-means fit (5 clusters) on that DataFrame. Add the each row's cluster label to the all_venues_sorted DataFrame then join with the all_merged Dataframe to produce the following:\n",

    "</h4><h3>Examine each cluster. -- How 'friendly' are individual clusters/neighborhoods to restaurants? </h3>\n",
    "<h4>The assumption here is that a 'restaurant friendly' neighborhood has many restaurants because the residents have historically supported them with their patronage.\n",
    "    The 'restaurant count' of all neighborhoods will be used as an indicator of proven 'restaurant friendly' neighborhoods.\n",
    "    The ratio of 'restaurants to bakery' is determined for each cluster.  Clusters that have higher ratios (e.g. > 30) or no bakeries are considered potentially good neighborhoods for a new bakery.  Clusters with low 'restaurants to bakery'ratios suggest those neighborhoods are 'saturated' with bakeries.\n",

    "<h4>\n",
    "Toronto and New York City both have urban neighborhoods. During the clustering creation a fixed radius (300 meters) was used and 517 neighborhoods were identified. The 'top ten venue' data of each neighborhood were identified using FourSquare data and a function. Five clusters of neighborhoods were created using using Kmeans using similitude amongst the 'top 10 venues'.\n",
    "</h4><h4>\n",
    "The five clusters were filtered to obtain restaurant and baker counts for each cluster. The guiding rule for suggesting a 'good bakery location' was to determine a ratio of 'restaurant to bakery' for each cluster. The hypothesis of this study is: a 'restaurant friendly' neighborhood would also be 'bakery friendly'. The ratio of 'restaurant to bakery' was determined for cluster as well as a count of restaurants. A cluster having a significant restaurant count and a high 'restaurant to bakery' ratio would be a good potential lead for a new bakery location.\n",
    "</h4>\n",
    "<h4>\n",
    "Clusters 2 and 5 have a 'restaurant to bakery' of 10.   This means that those neighborhoods are saturated with bakeries and any new competition would be too difficult.\n",
